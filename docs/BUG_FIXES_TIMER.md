# Bug Fixes for Timer Implementation

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Issues Fixed**: 2 critical bugs in timer functionality
**Status**: ✅ FIXED AND TESTED

---

## Summary of Issues

Two critical bugs were discovered during manual testing:

1. **Timer Keeps Adding Time** - Timer never expired, kept resetting indefinitely
2. **Account Lockout Timer Not Showing** - Account lockout showed error but no timer

---

## Issue 1: Timer Keeps Adding Time (Infinite Loop)

### The Problem

When IP rate limiting was triggered:
- Timer would count down normally
- But when timer reached 00:00 and user tried again
- Timer would reset and start counting again
- This continued indefinitely - user could NEVER log in
- Even restarting the server didn't fix it

### Root Cause

**Location**: `accounts/views.py` (original line 192-199)

```python
# BUGGY CODE (BEFORE):
if _is_rate_limited(...):
    # Calculate timer
    lockout_seconds = ...
    alert_message = "Too many sign-in attempts..."

    # BUG: Recording ANOTHER event even though already rate limited!
    _record_event(
        event_type=AuthenticationEvent.EventType.LOGIN,
        ip_address=ip_address,
        successful=False,
        reason="ip_rate_limited",
    )
```

**The Infinite Loop:**
```
1. User makes 5 failed login attempts
   → Events in DB: [event1, event2, event3, event4, event5]

2. User tries 6th time → Rate limited
   → Shows timer based on event1 (oldest)
   → BUG: Records event6 in database!
   → Events in DB: [event1, event2, event3, event4, event5, event6]

3. Timer expires (event1 is now older than 15 minutes)
   → event1 drops out of window
   → Events in window: [event2, event3, event4, event5, event6]

4. User tries again → STILL 5 events in window!
   → Rate limited again with NEW timer based on event2
   → BUG: Records event7!
   → Events in DB: [event2, event3, event4, event5, event6, event7]

5. REPEAT FOREVER... ∞
```

### The Fix

**Stop recording events when already rate limited:**

```python
# FIXED CODE (AFTER):
if is_ip_rate_limited:
    # Calculate timer
    lockout_seconds = ...
    alert_message = "Too many sign-in attempts..."

    # DO NOT record another event - prevents infinite loop!
    # No _record_event() call here
```

**Why This Works:**
- When rate limited, we DON'T add new events to the database
- The 5 existing events age naturally
- After 15 minutes, all 5 events are outside the window
- User can login again ✅

**Also Fixed For**:
- Signup rate limiting (`accounts/views.py:327`)

---

## Issue 2: Account Lockout Timer Not Showing

### The Problem

When account lockout was triggered:
- User would see error message but NO timer
- After refreshing page, IP rate limiting message appeared instead
- Account lockout timer never showed

### Root Cause

**Check Order Problem:**

```python
# BUGGY FLOW (BEFORE):
1. Check IP rate limiting FIRST
   └─> If triggered, return early with IP rate limiting message

2. Check if form is valid
3. Check if user exists
4. Check if account is locked ← NEVER REACHED!
5. Check password
```

**What Happened:**
```
User tries to login to "alice" with wrong password 5 times:

After 5 attempts:
- IP has 5 failed attempts → IP rate limited ✓
- Account has 5 failed attempts → Account locked ✓
- BOTH conditions are true!

User tries 6th time:
→ IP rate limiting check runs FIRST
→ Returns early with "Too many sign-in attempts" message
→ Account lockout check NEVER runs
→ Account lockout timer NEVER shows
```

### The Fix

**Check account lockout BEFORE IP rate limiting:**

```python
# FIXED FLOW (AFTER):
if form.is_valid():
    identifier = form.get_identifier()
    user = form.find_user()

    # 1. PRIORITY: Check if this specific account is locked
    if user and user.is_locked():
        # Show account lockout timer
        lockout_seconds = calculate_time(user.locked_until)
        alert_message = "Your account is locked..."

    # 2. Check IP rate limiting (after account lockout)
    elif _is_rate_limited(...):
        # Show IP rate limiting timer
        lockout_seconds = calculate_time(reset_time)
        alert_message = "Too many sign-in attempts..."

    # 3. Check if user exists
    elif user is None:
        ...

    # 4. Check password
    elif not user.check_password(password):
        ...
```

**Why This Works:**
- Account-specific lockouts take priority over IP rate limiting
- User sees the MOST RELEVANT message (their account is locked)
- Timer shows correctly for account lockout
- More user-friendly messaging

**Bonus Fix:**
- Also added timer display when account FIRST gets locked (on 5th failed attempt)
- Line 245-248 in `accounts/views.py`

## Testing Results

### Before Fixes
```
✅ 31/33 tests passing
❌ 2/33 tests failing
- test_login_locks_account_after_threshold
- test_account_lockout_from_different_ips
```

### After Fixes
```
✅ 33/33 tests passing
❌ 0/33 tests failing
```

### Manual Testing Verification

**Test 1: IP Rate Limiting Timer**
```
1. Made 5 failed login attempts
2. Saw timer: 14:52
3. Waited for timer to reach 00:00
4. Page refreshed automatically
5. ✅ Could login normally - NO infinite loop!
```

**Test 2: Account Lockout Timer**
```
1. Made 5 wrong password attempts for "alice"
2. Saw timer: 59:47
3. Message: "Your account is locked"
4. ✅ Timer displayed correctly!
5. Refreshed page
6. ✅ Still showed account lockout (not IP rate limiting)
```

**Test 3: Timer Display on 5th Attempt**
```
1. Made 4 wrong password attempts
2. 5th attempt with wrong password
3. ✅ Timer appeared immediately showing ~60:00
4. Message: "Your account is locked. Please wait..."
```

## Code Comparison

### Before (Buggy)

```python
# Login flow - BUGGY
if request.method == "POST":
    # Check IP rate limiting FIRST
    if _is_rate_limited(...):
        lockout_seconds = ...
        _record_event(...)  # BUG: Records another event!

    elif form.is_valid():
        user = form.find_user()

        # Account lockout check comes LATER
        if user.is_locked():
            # May never reach here if IP rate limited!
```

### After (Fixed)

```python
# Login flow - FIXED
if request.method == "POST":
    if form.is_valid():
        user = form.find_user()

        # Check account lockout FIRST (priority)
        if user and user.is_locked():
            lockout_seconds = ...
            # Account-specific message takes priority

        # Check IP rate limiting SECOND
        elif _is_rate_limited(...):
            lockout_seconds = ...
            # NO _record_event() - prevents infinite loop!
```

## Message Changes

Updated to be more consistent and user-friendly:

| Old Message | New Message |
|------------|-------------|
| "Too many failed attempts. Your account is locked for 60 minutes." | "Too many failed attempts. Your account is locked. Please wait before trying again." |
| "Your account is locked. Try again in X minutes." | "Your account is locked. Please wait before trying again." |

Timer still shows exact time remaining (MM:SS format).

## Lessons Learned

### Don't Record Events When Rate Limited
- Rate limiting should **check** existing events, not **create** new ones
- Recording events while rate limited creates infinite loops
- Only record events for actual login/signup **attempts**, not rate limit **blocks**

### Priority of Checks Matters
- Account-specific checks should come before IP-based checks
- More specific errors should take priority over general errors
- Better UX: "Your account is locked" vs "Too many attempts from this IP"

### Test Edge Cases
- Automated tests didn't catch the infinite loop issue
- Manual testing revealed the problem
- Need tests that simulate:
  - Multiple attempts after rate limit
  - Time passing between attempts
  - Both IP and account limits triggered simultaneously

---

## Impact

### Fixed
✅ Timer no longer adds infinite time
✅ Account lockout timer displays correctly
✅ More user-friendly error messages
✅ Better priority of security checks
✅ All 33 tests passing

### Unchanged
✅ IP rate limiting still works (15 min window)
✅ Account lockout still works (60 min lock)
✅ Timer countdown still functional
✅ Auto-refresh still works
✅ Form disabling still works

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Add test for infinite loop scenario**
   - Test that timer actually expires
   - Test multiple attempts after rate limit

2. **Add test for priority of checks**
   - Test when both IP and account are locked
   - Verify account lockout message shows

3. **Consider adding manual unlock**
   - Admin panel to unlock accounts
   - Email link to unlock after certain time

4. **Monitor rate limiting in production**
   - Track how often rate limits are hit
   - Adjust thresholds if needed
