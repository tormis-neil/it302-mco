## 1. What is the purpose of `test_rate_limiting_scenarios` and `test_timer_functionality`?

### Purpose: Automated Testing

These are **automated test files** that verify the rate limiting and timer features work correctly. Instead of manually testing every scenario (which takes time), these tests run automatically in seconds.

### `test_rate_limiting_scenarios.py` (9 tests)

Tests different **rate limiting scenarios**:

| Test | What It Checks |
|------|----------------|
| `test_successful_logins_do_not_trigger_rate_limit` | ✅ Successful logins don't count toward limit |
| `test_ip_rate_limiting_works_across_different_accounts` | ✅ IP limit applies to all accounts from same IP |
| `test_account_lockout_is_per_account_not_per_ip` | ✅ Each account has its own lockout counter |
| `test_account_lockout_from_different_ips` | ✅ Account can be locked from different IPs |
| `test_successful_login_resets_account_lockout_counter` | ✅ Counter resets after successful login |
| `test_lockout_expires_after_60_minutes` | ✅ Lockout automatically expires |
| `test_signup_rate_limiting_counts_all_attempts` | ✅ Signup counts both successful & failed |

### `test_timer_functionality.py` (10 tests)

Tests the **timer feature** specifically:

| Test | What It Checks |
|------|----------------|
| `test_login_rate_limit_returns_lockout_seconds` | ✅ Timer value calculated correctly for login |
| `test_signup_rate_limit_returns_lockout_seconds` | ✅ Timer value calculated correctly for signup |
| `test_login_template_contains_timer_when_rate_limited` | ✅ Timer HTML appears in login page |
| `test_signup_template_contains_timer_when_rate_limited` | ✅ Timer HTML appears in signup page |
| `test_account_lockout_returns_lockout_seconds` | ✅ Timer calculated for account lockout |
| `test_account_lockout_template_contains_timer` | ✅ Timer displays when account locked |
| `test_timer_accuracy_for_partial_lockout` | ✅ Timer accurate for 30-minute lockout |
| `test_no_timer_when_not_rate_limited` | ✅ No timer when not rate limited |
| `test_timer_uses_oldest_event_in_window` | ✅ Timer based on oldest event |
| `test_timer_minimum_value_is_one_second` | ✅ Timer never shows 0 or negative |

### Why Automated Tests Matter

**Without tests:**
- Have to manually test everything after each change
- Takes 10-15 minutes to test all scenarios
- Easy to miss edge cases
- Can't quickly verify nothing broke

**With tests:**
- Run `python manage.py test accounts` → 33 tests in 5 seconds ✅
- Automatically catches bugs before deployment
- Tests run on every commit
- Confidence that features still work

**Example**: When I fixed the infinite loop bug, tests immediately confirmed all 33 scenarios still work correctly!

## 2. Timer Disappears When Navigating Away - FIXED! ✅

### The Problem

You discovered a critical UX bug:

```
1. Get rate limited → See timer: 14:32
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Home"
3. Click back to "Sign In"
4. ❌ Timer and message GONE!
5. Try to login → Message and timer appear again
```

**This was confusing!** Users didn't know if they were still rate limited.

### Root Cause

The code only checked rate limiting on **POST requests** (form submissions), not **GET requests** (page loads).

```python
# BEFORE (Buggy):
def login_view(request):
    if request.method == "POST":  # Only checks on form submit!
        if _is_rate_limited(...):
            show_timer()
```

When you navigated away and back, you made a GET request (just loading the page), so the rate limit check never ran!

### The Fix

Now checks rate limiting **BEFORE** the POST check, so it runs for both GET and POST:

```python
# AFTER (Fixed):
def login_view(request):
    # Check rate limiting for BOTH GET and POST
    is_ip_rate_limited = _is_rate_limited(...)

    if is_ip_rate_limited:
        show_timer()  # Shows on every page load!

    if request.method == "POST" and not is_ip_rate_limited:
        # Process form submission
```

### What Changed

**Files Modified:**
- `accounts/views.py` lines 170-193 (login view)
- `accounts/views.py` lines 310-330 (signup view)

**New Behavior:**

```
1. Get rate limited → See timer: 14:32
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Home"
3. Click back to "Sign In"
4. ✅ Timer still shows: 14:15 (counting down!)
5. Click "Home" again
6. Come back to "Sign In"
7. ✅ Timer STILL shows: 13:58
8. Wait until 00:00
9. ✅ Page refreshes, can login now!
```

**Same for Signup page!**

### How to Test

```bash
# 1. Start server
python manage.py runserver

# 2. Go to login page
http://localhost:8000/accounts/login/

# 3. Make 5 failed login attempts
# Timer appears: ~14:52

# 4. Click "Sign Up" at the bottom
# (Goes to signup page)

# 5. Click browser back button OR click "Sign In"
# ✅ Timer should STILL be there! (and counting down)

# 6. Click "Home" link
# (Goes to home page)

# 7. Click "Sign In" link
# ✅ Timer should STILL be there!

# 8. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
# ✅ Timer should STILL be there!
```

## 3. IP Rate Limiting Time Not Exact 15 Minutes - This is CORRECT! ✅

### Why the Timer Varies

You noticed:
- **1st time**: Not exactly 15 minutes
- **2nd time**: Only 12 minutes

**This is actually correct behavior!** Here's why:

### How the Timer Works

The timer is based on when the **OLDEST event expires**, not when you make the 5th attempt.

#### Example: Why Timer Shows 12 Minutes

```
Timeline:

2:00 PM - Attempt 1 (wrong password)
2:01 PM - Attempt 2 (wrong password)
2:02 PM - Attempt 3 (wrong password)
2:05 PM - Attempt 4 (wrong password)
2:08 PM - Attempt 5 (wrong password) → Rate limited!

Timer calculation:
- Oldest event: 2:00 PM
- Window: 15 minutes
- Expires at: 2:15 PM
- Current time: 2:08 PM
- Timer shows: 2:15 PM - 2:08 PM = 7 minutes ✅

Wait 3 minutes...

2:11 PM - Try again → Still rate limited!
- Oldest event still: 2:00 PM
- Expires at: 2:15 PM
- Current time: 2:11 PM
- Timer shows: 2:15 PM - 2:11 PM = 4 minutes ✅

At 2:15 PM:
- Oldest event (2:00 PM) is now 15 minutes old
- Drops out of window
- All 5 events gone
- ✅ Can login again!
```

### Why This Makes Sense

**Design Goal**: Prevent rapid-fire attacks

If someone tries to brute-force your login:
- They make 5 attempts quickly (in 1-2 minutes)
- They get blocked for ~14 minutes remaining
- Can't just wait a few minutes and try again
- Must wait full 15 minutes from their FIRST attempt

### Visual Timeline

```
0:00 → ❌ Attempt 1
0:30 → ❌ Attempt 2
1:00 → ❌ Attempt 3
1:30 → ❌ Attempt 4
2:00 → ❌ Attempt 5 → 🔒 Rate Limited!
      Timer shows: ~13 minutes

Why? Because oldest attempt (0:00) expires at 15:00
Current time is 2:00, so 15:00 - 2:00 = 13:00 remaining
```

### Different Scenario: Slower Attempts

```
0:00 → ❌ Attempt 1
3:00 → ❌ Attempt 2
6:00 → ❌ Attempt 3
9:00 → ❌ Attempt 4
12:00 → ❌ Attempt 5 → 🔒 Rate Limited!
       Timer shows: ~3 minutes

Why? Oldest attempt (0:00) expires at 15:00
Current time is 12:00, so 15:00 - 12:00 = 3:00 remaining
```

### This is Good Security!

✅ **Prevents gaming the system**: Can't just make 4 attempts, wait, then make more
✅ **Fair to legitimate users**: If you make a mistake, you're only blocked for remaining time
✅ **Sliding window**: Old attempts naturally expire

**Note**: The MAXIMUM timer you'll ever see is ~15 minutes (if you make all 5 attempts within seconds of each other).

## 4. Does Account Lockout Work on Sign Up Page?

### Short Answer: NO (and this is intentional!)

**Account lockout does NOT apply to the signup page.**

### Why Not?

**Account lockout requires an existing account:**

```python
# Account lockout checks:
if user and user.is_locked():  # ← Need a user object!
    show_timer()
```

**On signup page:**
- User is creating a NEW account
- Account doesn't exist yet
- No user object to check
- Therefore, no account lockout possible

### What DOES Work on Signup Page?

**IP Rate Limiting** works on signup:

```
1. Create 5 accounts from IP 192.168.1.100
   → account1, account2, account3, account4, account5 ✅

2. Try to create 6th account
   → 🔒 IP rate limited!
   → Timer shows: ~59:47 (1 hour)
   → Message: "Too many sign-up attempts from this network"

3. Wait 1 hour
   → ✅ Can create accounts again
```

### Security Mechanisms Per Page

| Mechanism | Login Page | Signup Page |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **IP Rate Limiting** | ✅ YES<br>5 failed logins / 15 min | ✅ YES<br>5 signups / 1 hour |
| **Account Lockout** | ✅ YES<br>5 wrong passwords = locked 60 min | ❌ NO<br>(no account exists yet) |

### Why This Makes Sense

**Signup Page Security:**
- Prevents mass account creation
- Limits spam registrations
- IP-based because no account exists yet

**Login Page Security:**
- Prevents brute-force password guessing
- Two layers: IP rate limiting AND account lockout
- Account-based because user exists

### Example Flow

```
Attacker tries to abuse signup:

Scenario 1: Create many accounts
→ IP rate limiting kicks in after 5 signups ✅

Scenario 2: Try to lock an account during signup
→ Not possible - account doesn't exist yet ✅

Attacker tries to abuse login:

Scenario 1: Try many passwords on one account
→ Account lockout kicks in after 5 attempts ✅

Scenario 2: Try to attack multiple accounts from one IP
→ IP rate limiting kicks in after 5 attempts total ✅
```
