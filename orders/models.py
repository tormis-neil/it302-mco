Models to support cart management and order history.

Models:
- Cart: Active shopping cart for a user (one per user)
- CartItem: Individual items in a cart
- Order: Completed checkout captured for history
- OrderItem: Line items in a completed order

Current Status:
- Models exist but NOT connected to views yet
- UI shows placeholder data only
- Full implementation planned for Phase 2

Relationships:
- User (1) ←→ (1) Cart
- Cart (1) ←→ (Many) CartItem
- User (1) ←→ (Many) Order
- Order (1) ←→ (Many) OrderItem

Used by:
- orders/views.py: Currently shows sample data (not real cart/orders)
- Future: Will be used for actual order processing

Related Files:
- orders/views.py: Placeholder views with sample data
- orders/forms.py: Cart and checkout forms (ready for Phase 2)
- menu/models.py: MenuItem referenced by CartItem and OrderItem
